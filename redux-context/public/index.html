<!-- 
	Be it Redux or context both have their own way of handling,
	and it might lead to rerender a component different number of times,
	but in the end react does a comparision btw DOM and Virtual DOM and does smart update,
	(you can inspect and see elements tab instead of whole hard refresh it updates smartly)
